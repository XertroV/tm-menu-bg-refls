# Trackmania Menu Bg Reflections

This plugin lets you modify the reflection of the car in main menu backgrounds. It's spun-off of [Menu Background Chooser](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/menu-bg-chooser).

There are only two parameters: "opacity" and "angle". Neither is intuitive, but it's fun to mess around with nonetheless.

After you install the plugin, you need to go to a new menu, then back to the main menu for the plugin to start working.

**Note! This plugin uses developer hooks and thus may be fragile!**
