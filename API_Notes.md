camera:

- angle of 0: item pointing fwd
- angle <180: item pointing stage right
- angle >180: item pointing stage left
- camera angle is downward pointing
  - I think the reflection thing is meant to match the camera angle mb, something like that

ItemCreate:

- model name
  - crashes:
    - ""
    - "DefaultPlayerModel"
- most inputs default to 'CarSport'
- others known: 'CharacterPilot', 'HelmetPilot'
